# image_tool_test

### Intro
This is a in-dev repo. Currently, it does not allow individual files to be uploaded. That is WIP.

### How to run this?
1. On python 3.7 create a virtual env of your choice.(optional but recommended)
2. Use requirements.txt to install the libraries. 
3. In that virtual env, use this
    `python app.py`
4. Hopefully everything should run!

### Results
The results will be saved in file 

  a. *test.csv*
  
  b. *tab_pres.csv*
